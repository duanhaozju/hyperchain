# domain means self domain, it will use this to reverse connect to remote peer
# domain not means hostname, one domain maybe consist of a lot of hosts
# so, if here configurate a item : domain1 127.0.0.1:8001
# domain1 may include host1, host2, when host1 got the addrs, it will parse the addr list,
# and got the domain1's addr to reverse connect. The same to host2.
domain: "domain2"

# addr is (domain,endpoint) pair, those items defined the ip address:port which
# other domains' host how connect to self
addrs:
  - domain1 127.0.0.1:50012
  - domain2 127.0.0.1:50012
  - domain3 127.0.0.1:50012
  - domain4 127.0.0.1:50012
